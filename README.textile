h1. RailsBpm

Rails BPM is a _proof_of_concept_ of Ruby on Rails plugin/engine for building Business Process Management solutions. It is based on "Ruote":http://ruote.rubyforge.org/ and "RuoteKit":https://github.com/tosch/ruote-kit was created by extending "ruote-on-rails.":https://github.com/tosch/ruote-on-rails 

Idea is to put your process into app/processes your tasks into app/controllers/tasks and app/views/tasks and participants into app/participants and let RailsBpm do the rest of the job. For now it is really implemented only to show haw can it be done it is far from complete.
