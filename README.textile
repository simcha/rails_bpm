h1. RailsBpm

Rails BPM is a _proof_of_concept_ of Ruby on Rails plugin/engine for building Business Process Management solutions. It is based on "Ruote":http://ruote.rubyforge.org/ and "RuoteKit":https://github.com/tosch/ruote-kit was created by extending "ruote-on-rails.":https://github.com/tosch/ruote-on-rails 

Idea is to put your process into app/processes your tasks into app/controllers/tasks and app/views/tasks and participants into app/participants and let RailsBpm do the rest of the job. For now it is really implemented only to show haw can it be done it is far from complete.

h2. Install

Make new rails application and remove index.html file.
 
Install the plugin by adding it to Gemfile:

<pre><code>gem 'rails_bpm', :git => 'http://github.com/simcha/rails_bpm.git'
gem 'ruote', :git => 'http://github.com/jmettraux/ruote.git'
gem 'ruote-kit', :git => 'http://github.com/tosch/ruote-kit.git'
</pre></code>
For now you must use git version of ruote with fixed paging support [thanks John :)]

And running

<pre><code>bundle install

rails generate rails_bpm:install

rails generate rails_bpm:example
</pre></code>
